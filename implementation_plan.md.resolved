# Implementation Plan - Website Build

## Goal Description
Build/Refine the "GROW" demo website to meet the **AI500 Stage 1** competition requirements. The site must clearly present the Problem, Solution, Team, "Why Us", Roadmap, and Technical Implementation (including AI usage).

## User Review Required
- [ ] **PRD Review**: I need the PRD to populate the specific content for each section.
- [ ] **Team Details**: Need full names, roles, skills, and links for all registered team members.
- [ ] **Tech Stack**: Confirmation of the specific tools/AI models used.

## Proposed Changes
The website structure will be updated to strictly follow the competition criteria:

### Structure Updates
1.  **Splash Screen (Design Req)**
    - Big "GROW" text (Glowing).
    - "Boshlash" (Start) button.
    - Animation on click -> Loader -> Main Site.
2.  **Problem (`Muammo`)**
    - Content: Farmers rely on intuition, leading to wrong crops, water waste, and low yield.
3.  **Solution (`Yechim`)**
    - Content: GROW App (AI Land Analysis, Crop Recs, Schedules).
    - Benefits: +15-25% Yield, -30-40% Costs, Water saving.
4.  **How it Works (`Qanday ishlaydi`)**
    - Steps: 1. Land Analysis (Tohist API), 2. Crop Selection (AI), 3. Prep Plan, 4. Planting, 5. Schedules, 6. Monitoring.
5.  **Roadmap (`Yo‘l xaritasi`)**
    - Stages: Idea -> Prototype (Current) -> MVP -> Launch.
6.  **Team (`Jamoa`)**
    - *Note: User did not provide specific names. Using placeholders.*
    - Roles: AI/ML, Frontend, Backend/Fullstack.
7.  **Why Us (`Nega aynan biz`)**
    - Focus: Scientific approach, Data-driven, Real-time adaptation.
8.  **Contact (`Bog‘lanish`)**
    - Email: ai500@itcommunity.uz (from prompt) / Team contact.

### Design Specifications
-   **Theme**: Dark Green (`#0b6b3a`, `#05140f`).
-   **Effects**: Glowing text for headings, Fade-up animations for sections.
-   **Interactions**: Hover effects on buttons, smooth scrolling.

### Technical Tasks
-   [ ] Refactor [index.html](file:///c:/Users/user/Downloads/AI500/index.html) to match the PRD content exactly.
-   [ ] Ensure "Why Us" and "Tech Stack" sections are present.
-   [ ] Implement the specific Splash -> Loader -> Home flow.
